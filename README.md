SPAM Email Detection
This repository contains a machine learning-based system for detecting SPAM emails. The project demonstrates various techniques for building and evaluating models that classify emails as either SPAM or non-SPAM (HAM).

Key features include:

Data Preprocessing: Handles text data cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using techniques such as TF-IDF and word embeddings.
Model Training: Implements various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Deep Learning (RNN, LSTM) for classification.
Performance Evaluation: Provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess model effectiveness.
Deployment: Offers scripts and examples for deploying the trained models in a production environment.
Dataset: Includes a sample dataset of labeled emails for testing and training
